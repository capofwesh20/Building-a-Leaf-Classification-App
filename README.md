Breakdown

* finding computer vision datasets and pretrained models ðŸ“–
* fine-tuning an image classifier model on new data ðŸ‘¾
* deploying a [Gradio app](http://gradio.dev/) you can run on your phone or laptop ðŸ“·
* measuring the performance of a classification model on test data and the real world ðŸ“ˆ

# Introduction

Beans are an important cereal food crop in many parts of the world. However, certain diseases can damage bean plants, causing food shortages. As a result, it is critical to monitor the leaves of bean plants frequently and accurately. Many farming businesses are turning to imaging and machine learning to monitor their crops automatically and accurately.

This is a great example of where **image classification** can solve a real business problem. The concepts you will learn in this project will be generally applicable to many other kinds of image classification, and more broadly machine learning, tasks. 

Our end goal will be to build a web-application that can take in an image of a bean leaf and predict whether it is healthy or diseased. The app will look something like this:
